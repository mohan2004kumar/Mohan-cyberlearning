# Mohan’s Cybersecurity Learning Journey
Welcome to my cybersecurity training repo! This project documents my hands-on journey to master tools like Wireshark, preparing for a SOC Analyst role by August 2025.

## About
- **Goal**: Land a high-paying cybersecurity job (e.g., SOC Analyst, Threat Hunter).
- **Tools**: Wireshark, Nmap (more to come).
- **Lab**: VMware with Parrot OS and Windows 10 VM.

## Structure
- **Day0/**: TCP/IP basics and Wireshark intro.
- **Day1/**: ICMP/HTTP traffic capture and analysis.
- **Day2/**: Malicious PCAP analysis (malware detection).
- **Day3/**: Wireshark filters and statistics.
- **Reports/**: Detailed PDF reports for each day.
- **Screenshots/**: Visuals from Wireshark.
- **PCAPs/**: Packet capture files.

## Highlights
- **Day 2**: Identified malware (Java dropper, Flash script) from `stand.trustandprobaterealty.com` (IP: 37.200.69.143).
- **Day 3**: Filtered HTTP traffic, analyzed IP conversations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/MohanCyberLearning.git`
2. Open PCAPs in Wireshark.
3. Review reports for insights.

## Progress
- April 5-8, 2025: Completed Days 0-3.
- Next: Nmap scanning (Week 2).
